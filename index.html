                <h2>Site History</h2>
                <p>
                  Originally the premises, that we have now converted into a sleek and modern trade centre, was owned and operated by Avon Inflatables.
                  The building itself is steeped in history; being the location at which Avon designed and developed some of their best-in-class
                  RIBs (Rigid Inflatable Boats). The products that once passed through these doors have been used worldwide, with uses ranging from
                  military to recreational use, and we feel honoured to be returning this derelict shell to its former glory.

                <h2>On Arrival</h2>
                <p>
                  When we first arrived on the site it was clear that this was going to be a large project. Set in approximately 2.7 acres of land,
                  with a footprint of around 35,000 square feet, the derelict factory seemed enormous. Work on site began almost immediately after
                  the documents had been signed and the progress that our team made was astonishing. Within two weeks, the exterior had been totally
                  transformed from a severely overgrown wilderness to an organised and clear working environment. After years of neglect, the building
                  was finally receiving the attention it so desperately needed.

                <h2>The Design</h2>
                <p>
                  From the earliest design sketches on scrap pieces of paper to the 3D rendered CAD drawings carried out by our architecture team,
                  the design of Dafen Trade Park has been a primary focus from day one. We take pride in creating functional and beautiful
                  buildings that really deliver on even the most acute aspects of usability. We notice the fine details that others may not and
                  aim to provide a solution that is not just satisfactory, but one that has been fine tuned to ensure the highest level of quality.

                <p>
                  Now, at the end of our journey, it's clear to us that our commitment and passion for this project has been worth it. We have
                  had immense pleasure from watching the development take shape and we are extremely proud of what our local team of craftsmen
                  has been able to achieve. We feel that supporting the local community is an extremely important goal and one that resonates
                  throughout the development process of Dafen Trade Park and we hope that this will remain the case throughout the running of the
                  park.

                Throughout the development process we ensured that we documented our progress. It was of great importance to us that
                we were able to demonstrate just how dramatically the building changed throughout the transformation, and we thought that
                the best way to do this would be to produce a photographic journal.
