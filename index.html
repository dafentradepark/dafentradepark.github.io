                <h2>Site History</h2>
                <p>
                  The products that once passed through these doors have been used by an
                  extraordinary number of people worldwide, providing the building itself with a history rich in fabrication.
                  The premises, that have now been transformed into a sleek and modern trade centre, were originally owned and operated by Avon Inflatables.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  This was the location at which Avon designed and developed some of their best-in-class RIBs (Rigid Inflatable Boats),
                  which were adopted for use by the  military, the coast guard and many other essential organisations. This allowed Avon Inflatables to
                  redefine the boating industry from their modest Llanelli based factory and provide a plethora of skilled jobs to local tradesmen.

                <h2>On Arrival</h2>
                <p>
                  When we first arrived on the site it was clear that this was going to be a large project. Set in approximately 2.7 acres of land,
                  with a footprint of around 35,000 square feet, the derelict factory seemed as though it would never end.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  We began working on site almost immediately after
                  the documents had been signed and the progress that our team made within the first few weeks was astonishing.
                  In around two weeks, the exterior had been totally transformed.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  From a severely overgrown wilderness a clear and organised working environment began to emerge. After years of neglect, the building
                  was finally receiving the attention it so desperately needed.

                <h2>The Design</h2>
                <p>
                  From the earliest design sketches on scrap pieces of paper to the 3D rendered CAD drawings produced by our architecture team,
                  the design of Dafen Trade Park has been the primary focus since day one. As a company we take pride in creating functional and beautiful
                  spaces that deliver on even the most acute aspects of usability.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  We notice the finer details that others may not and
                  aim to provide a solution that is not just satisfactory, but one that has been fine tuned to ensure the highest level of quality.

                <p>
                  At the end of our journey, it's clear that our commitment and passion to the project has been worth it. The pleasure we have
                  taken from watching the development take shape is almost too much to put into words and it has made us extremely proud of what our skilled team of craftsmen
                  have been able to achieve.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Supporting the local community is an extremely important goal and one that resonates
                  throughout the history and development of Dafen Trade Park. This will remain the case throughout the running of the
                  park and we hope to see that many local businesses embrace the space that we have to offer.

                We are a small team with a focused eye for detail, commitment and workmanship. Without our team, our goals for Dafen Trade Park
                would not have been achievable and so I would like to introduce you to each individual who has helped to make this
                journey possible.
