                                <h4 class="article-title">When arriving on site we were immediately struck by its potential.</h4>
                                <p class="article-text">This site had been available to purchase for several years yet it had been overlooked by many potential investors and developers over that period. Being a Llanelli based company we had been aware that the site was for sale however, like a large number of passers by we had not really achknowledged the old Avon Inflatables site. It was overgrown and had been derelict for years.</p>
                                <p class="article-text">However in early 2014 Robert Rees, director and CEO of the Rees Group, organised to view the site. Upon arrival it was clear that this was not something that could be overlooked any longer. The old factory was the perfect project.</p>
                                <p class="article-text">Sitting on 2.74 acres of land situated just 4.3 miles from junction 48 of the M4 the factory featured an ideal location with more than enough land to play with. The factory itself offers 35,000 square feet of open floor space, with nothing but steel pillars in the building. It was any developers dream yet no one had realised it.</p>

We were told that the building was originally constructed for use during the war time era however it was never required.</p>

This included any equipment that had been left within the factory from its previous owners as well as any unnecessary connections. We cleared out the old office spaces discovering a number of beautiful, original draftsman sketches from its previous use as the home of Avon Inflatables. We kept these images and we hope to display them on site when the transformation is complete.</p>

However during stage two of the development the inside will have a very large amount of attention. It is our goal to split the building up into a number of trade stands.</p>
